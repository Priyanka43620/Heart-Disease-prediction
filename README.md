# Heart-Disease-prediction
This Project is an Real Life Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Field. The main objective is to predict better predictions of Heart Disease based on Patients' Body following attributes:
# ðŸ“Š Dataset description
This dataset consists of 11 features and a target variable. It has 6 nominal variables and 5 numeric variables. The detailed description of all the features are as follows:

1. Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
2. Sex: Gender of patient (Male - 1, Female - 0) (Nominal)
3. Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by patient categorized into 1 typical, 2 typical angina, 3 non- anginal pain, 4 asymptomatic (Nominal)
4. resting bp s: Level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
5. cholestrol: Serum cholestrol in mg/dl (Numeric)
6. fasting blood sugar: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
7. resting ecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values 0 : Normal 1: Abnormality in ST-T wave 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (Nominal)
8. max heart rate: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
9. exercise angina: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
10. oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in comparison with the state of rest (Numeric)
11. ST slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise 0: Normal 1: Upsloping 2: Flat 3: Downsloping (Nominal
